    cd <your-frontend-folder>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    -   Create a new file in the root of your project named `.env`.
    -   Add the following line to it, pointing to your local backend server:
        ```
        VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
        ```

### Running the Development Server

-   Start the Vite development server:

## Project Structure

The project is structured into pages and components for clarity and maintainability.

/srcâ”œâ”€â”€ /componentsâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ChatBox.jsxâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ TypingIndicator.jsxâ”œâ”€â”€ /pagesâ”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Join.jsx      # The landing page for creating/joining roomsâ”‚   â””â”€â”€ Room.jsx      # The main video call and chat interfaceâ””â”€â”€ App.jsx           # Main application component with routing
-   **`App.jsx`**: The root of the application. It sets up `react-router-dom` to handle navigation between the `Join` and `Room` pages.
-   **`pages/Join.jsx`**: Contains the UI and logic for the landing page, including the animated cards, input fields for username and Room ID, and avatar selection.
-   **`pages/Room.jsx`**: The core of the application. It manages the WebRTC peer connections, handles all Socket.IO events for signaling and chat, and renders the video feeds and media controls.
-   **`components/`**: Contains reusable components like the `ChatBox` and `TypingIndicator` that are used within the `Room` page.

## Deployment

This application is configured for easy deployment to services like Vercel or Netlify.

### Environment Variables

Before deploying, you must set the `VITE_BACKEND_URL` environment variable in your deployment provider's settings.

-   **Variable Name:** `VITE_BACKEND_URL`
-   **Value:** The public URL of your deployed backend server (e.g., `https://your-backend-name.onrender.com`).

This ensures that your deployed frontend can communicate with your live backend server.

### Main Dependencies

-   **`react`**: For building the user interface.
-   **`react-router-dom`**: For handling client-side routing.
-   **`socket.io-client`**: For real-time communication with the backend server.
-   **`simple-peer`**: A wrapper for WebRTC to simplify peer-to-peer connections.
-   **`framer-motion`**: For creating smooth, declarative animations.
-   **`lucide-react`**: For clean and modern icons.
-   **`react-hot-toast`**: For user-friendly notifications.
-   **`vite`**: As the build tool and development server.
